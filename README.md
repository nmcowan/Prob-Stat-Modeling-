# Prob-Stat-Modeling

The purpose of this project was to implement a simulation of a Skype data packet stream, interpret which distribution the packets were sent in, and then to send a secret message without being detected by a surveilling warden. 

The actual implementation of the project is seen in Part 5. The other parts consist of build-up as we demonstrate how to properly interpret distributions with qqplot.
